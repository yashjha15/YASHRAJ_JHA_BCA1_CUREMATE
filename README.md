SHORT PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Access to reliable healthcare remains a major challenge, especially in underserved regions where awareness and access to medical professionals are limited. Many individuals either delay seeking medical help or rely on unverified sources, often leading to serious health issues.

CUREMATE is an AI-powered medical chatbot designed to bridge this critical gap. It provides users with instant, preliminary medical assessments and treatment suggestions based on their symptoms. By leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a well-structured medical knowledge base, CUREMATE understands user queries in everyday language and offers accurate, relevant health guidance.

The chatbot interacts with users in a conversational format—text or voice—and helps identify potential conditions while recommending basic remedies or next steps. When necessary, it also guides users toward professional medical consultation or emergency care, ensuring timely intervention.

CUREMATE is built to be multilingual, responsive, and available on both web and mobile platforms, making it a valuable tool for individuals who may not have immediate access to a healthcare facility. By offering reliable, accessible, and affordable support, CUREMATE empowers people to make informed decisions about their health, anytime and anywhere.
